**Current Issue:**
- Using `sequelize.sync({ force: false })` in development
- No proper migration system
- Schema changes require manual intervention
- Risk of data loss in production

**Solution:**
1. Stop using `sequelize.sync()` in production
2. Create migration files for existing schema
3. Document migration workflow
4. Add migration step to deployment process

```bash
# Create migration files
npx sequelize-cli migration:create --name initial-schema
npx sequelize-cli migration:create --name add-subscription-fields

# Run migrations
npm run migrate
```

**Estimated Time:** 2 days

---

### 7. **No Error Monitoring**

- Real-time error notifications
- Stack traces and context
- User impact tracking

```bash
npm install @sentry/node @sentry/react-native
```

**Uptime Monitoring: UptimeRobot (Free)**
- Monitor 50 URLs free
- 5-minute checks

- Not all endpoints have validation
- No XSS protection on user content
- No file upload size limits enforced
- Missing rate limiting per user (only per IP)

**Required:**
1. Add express-validator to all endpoints
2. Sanitize user-generated content (posts, comments)
3. Add file size/type validation
4. Implement per-user rate limiting
5. Add SQL injection tests (Sequelize helps but verify)

**Estimated Time:** 2 days
